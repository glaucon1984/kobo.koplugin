## About this fork

This is a fork of [OGKevin/kobo.koplugin](https://github.com/OGKevin/kobo.koplugin). The plugin,
including all of its Bluetooth support, is the work of [OGKevin](https://github.com/OGKevin) and its
contributors. This fork only adds one feature on top of it: support for Bluetooth remotes that
emulate a touch screen.

The fork was modified in October 2026, starting from the upstream `main` branch at commit `682c0a8`
(version 0.4.1 plus later upstream changes that were not yet released). The changes are in
`src/lib/bluetooth/input_device_handler.lua`, `src/lib/bluetooth/bluetooth_input_reader.lua`,
`src/bluetooth_keybindings.lua`, `src/kobo_bluetooth.lua` and `main.lua`. It
is distributed under the same licence as the original, the
[GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE). It has not been submitted upstream yet.

### Touch-screen style remotes ("TikTok rings")

Some cheap page-turner rings and remotes do not send key presses. They present themselves as a touch
screen and send every button as a simulated finger gesture (a swipe or a tap), because they are made
for scrolling short videos on a phone. With the original plugin such a remote connects, but "Register
button" never detects a press.

This fork does two things so these devices can be used like any other remote:

- **Driver binding.** The kernel classifies such a device as multitouch and leaves it to the
  `hid-multitouch` driver, which Kobo kernels do not include, so the device never gets an input
  node. When a connected Bluetooth HID device has no kernel driver, the plugin registers it with
  `hid-generic` so the input node is created. This lasts until the Kobo reboots and is repeated when
  needed.
- **Gesture to key translation.** A touch contact is turned into one synthetic key press, which can
  be bound like a normal button. A swipe fires as soon as its direction is clear.

  | Gesture     | Key name   |
  | ----------- | ---------- |
  | Tap         | `KEY_1000` |
  | Swipe up    | `KEY_1001` |
  | Swipe down  | `KEY_1002` |
  | Swipe left  | `KEY_1003` |
  | Swipe right | `KEY_1004` |

Buttons can only be told apart by the direction of their gesture. Two buttons that swipe in the same
direction, or tap at different positions, register as the same key. Remotes that emulate a mouse
(relative movement) instead of a touch screen are not covered.

### Swapping page-turn buttons when the screen is inverted

For a remote that is attached to the reader (for example built into a case), turning the reader
around to hold it in the other hand also flips the remote, so the upper button becomes the lower
one. Enable **Bluetooth → Settings → Swap page-turn buttons when screen is inverted** to reverse the
next/previous page buttons while the screen is rotated 180°. Combined with a button bound to "Invert
rotation", the upper button then always turns the page the same way. The setting is off by default.

### Faster auto-connect

With auto-connect enabled, the plugin now contacts paired devices directly right after Bluetooth
comes on and opens a remote's input as soon as it appears, instead of waiting for a discovery scan
and for the Bluetooth service to report the connection. On the test setup this brought the time from
waking the reader to a working remote down from roughly 30 seconds to between 6 and 14 seconds. See
[auto-connect](docs/settings/bluetooth-settings/auto-connect.md).

### Tested device

Only one remote has been tested, on a Kobo Clara BW:

- **WX02** ring remote (sold as "wxlj-02", three buttons, classic Bluetooth, announces itself with
  Apple's vendor ID `05AC:0220`), for example [this listing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0GTVH33JR).
  The next/previous buttons send swipe down/up (`KEY_1002` / `KEY_1001`). The middle button sends a
  tap (`KEY_1000`) and, on its first press after power-on, a power key (`KEY_116`).

To use it: pair and connect the ring from the plugin's Bluetooth menu, open its key bindings, choose
an action such as next page, select "Register button" and press the ring button.
